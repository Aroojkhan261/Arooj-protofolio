          <div class="para"> <p>As a beginner web developer, I am passionate about bringing ideas to life through code. My journey into web development began with a curiosity about how websites work, which quickly turned into a desire to create my own. I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am continuously learning and expanding my skills. I enjoy problem-solving and take pride in writing clean, efficient code. While I am still early in my career, I am eager to take on new challenges and projects that will help me grow as a developer. My goal is to build responsive, user-friendly websites that not only look great but also provide a seamless experience for users. I am excited to contribute my skills and creativity to meaningful projects and to continue developing as a web professional.</p>
